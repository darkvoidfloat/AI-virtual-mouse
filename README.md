# AI-virtual-mouse
This project implements a fully functional AI-based Virtual Mouse that uses your webcam to detect and track hand gestures for controlling the mouse pointer â€” without touching any physical device. Built using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI, this system replaces traditional mouse input with real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition.
